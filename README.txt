This project is executed in 2 steps and the files for each step are stored in the corresponding folders. 
Step 1 is concerned with the PostgreSQL relational database and Step 2 with the Neo4j graph database.
It is recommended that step1 is executed first, although it's not necessary.
Each individual folder contains a different README file that describes all files in detail.
